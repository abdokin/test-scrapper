We're building an app similar to TestGorilla, where businesses can create assessments and invite candidates to complete them. To populate the Test Library, we need to generate test data, with the following requirements:

1- Test Language: The test data should be in French.

2- Test Structure:
- Generate a test with a pool of 40+ questions. Each test will randomly select a number of questions to be answered, specified by the variable questions_to_answer.
- The test should include 3 to 4 preview questions that are clearly marked.

3- Question Types:
- Use two question formats: multiple-choice (one correct answer) and multiple-response (multiple correct answers).
- Ensure that most questions are multiple-choice, as per the TestGorilla guidelines.
- Each question should have exactly 4 answer options.
- For multiple-response questions, randomly vary the number of correct answers between 1 and 4. Avoid patterns where all or most of the multiple-response questions have the same number of correct answers (e.g., avoid always having 3 correct answers).
  - Ensure a good mix across the test, where some multiple-response questions have only 1 or 2 correct answers, while others may have 3 or 4. This will prevent predictability and ensure a varied test-taking experience.

4- Test Duration: Estimate the total test time (duration_seconds) based on the number of questions and the level of difficulty (entry_level, intermediate, or advanced).

5- Test Categories:
- Each test belongs to one category, selected from the following: Cognitive ability, Language, Personality & culture, Programming skills, Role-specific skills, Situational judgment, Software skills, or Typing speed.

6- JSON Format: The generated test data must adhere to the format specified in the attached JSON template for consistency.
