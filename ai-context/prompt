we're developing an app like TestGorilla where you create an assessment and invite candidates to pass it
so for the Test library we need some tests data

Generate test data with a pool of 40+ questions. The number of questions to be answered by the user is specified by `questions_to_answer`. Estimate `duration_seconds` based on `questions_to_answer`, keeping in mind level of test which can be one of these (entry_level, intermediate, advanced)

and mark 3 to 4 question as preview.

also the type of question can be either multiple-choice (select one) or multiple_response (select multiple)

for the Count of options as test gorilla said in its doc: (For each question, you can provide between two and ten options, but 4 is the most often)

also for the test category it can be  one of these (Cognitive ability | Language | Personality & culture | Programming skills | Role-specific skills | Situational judgment | Software skills | Typing speed)
