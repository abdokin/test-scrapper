Generate test data with a pool of 40+ questions. The number of questions to be answered by the user is specified by `questions_to_answer`. Estimate `duration_seconds` based on `questions_to_answer`, keeping in mind the level of the questions. The questions should be in French.

Don't forget the application levels, which can be chosen from the following enum:
level: { entry_level: 0, intermediate: 1, advanced: 2 }

In question options, you can add multiple correct answers and preferably add between 5 to 10 options, with the correct ones being between 1 and 4.

Mark 3 to 4 questions as preview always. Provide the output as JSON.
