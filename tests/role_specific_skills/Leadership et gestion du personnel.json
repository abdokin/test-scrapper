    "description": "Powerful leaders scale your organization’s potential. They carry out impactful strategies and provide actionable directives that get results.  \n\nThis Leadership and People Management test evaluates candidates’ abilities to delegate authority and task responsibility, plan and support the development of others, provide timely guidance and feedback, and gain acceptance of ideas and plans. Rather than proposing a specific leadership style, this test follows the situational theory of leadership developed by Blanchard and Hersey and asks candidates to evaluate factors to decide when to tell, sell, participate, or delegate in different scenarios based on the needs of each situation.\n\nThis screening test will help you identify leaders who have a genuine interest in developing others and can unite talent behind important objectives. These are the leaders who understand how to align the needs and goals of the organization with the skills and aspirations of their team members to produce results and satisfaction at all levels. Successful leaders lead by example and create a space where people can share ideas, ask questions, and be accountable for their actions.",
